If you think of data science like a race car, the data engineers are the pit crew. They’re not driving the car, but they make the car much easier to drive. Data engineers make sure the data flow is running smoothly, monitor systems, anticipate problems, and repair the data pipeline whenever problems arise. They extract and gather data from multiple sources and load it into a single, easy-to-query database. In short, data engineers make data scientists’ lives easier.\n" +

This perspective can help you understand the many Azure offerings and assess which best fit your organization's cloud strategy. Those just entering the cloud will find the course to be a valuable resource they can return to again and again. Instructor Walt Ritscher kicks off the course by comparing the four cornerstones of the cloud: software as a service, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and service as a service. He then covers Azure subscription options and costs and dives deeper into specific Azure services, including web hosting, cloud storage, Azure security, infrastructure, DevOps tools, backup, hybrid cloud systems, and media encoding, as well as event and notification services. Review the services that interest you or zoom out for a more complete picture of this powerful cloud-computing platform.",
